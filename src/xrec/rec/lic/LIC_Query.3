.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR LIC_InputImage ,
.B LIC_InputField
and
.B LIC_OutputImage
return pointers to the input image, input vector field and output image,
respectively.
.BR LIC_Length ,
.B LIC_Phase
and
.B LIC_Frequency
return the current filter kernel length, phase and frequency, respectively.
.PP
.B LIC_ConfiguredPixelType
returns a pointer to a character string representation of the pixel type
configured into the LIC library.
.B LIC_ConfiguredPixelSize
returns the size in bytes of pixel values configured into the LIC library.
.PP
Return values from

.SH BUGS
Neither
.B LIC_ConfiguredPixelType
nor
.BR LIC_ConfiguredPixelSize .
should be necessary.  Such issues should be handled dynamically at run-time
instead of compile-time.
