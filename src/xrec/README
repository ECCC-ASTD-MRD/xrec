What you need

A Fortran compiler
libXm library
rmnlib (most of the modules : FSTD2000, base, primitives, readlx)

Some extra stuff
libgdb.a is a library developed by Michel Grenier from CMC
to draw high resolution geography outline
libgd2.a is GD implementation of GD.

What is in the directories

autog	: A library to generate x-y graphs.
	  Used for vertical profiles and time series
gd_wgl  : GD implementation of wgl. For now unimplemented filler code
	  As of September 2025, this code is commented out
gmp     : Geography drawing routines
include : The .h files needed by xrec
main    : where most of source of xrec is
select  : Record selector code
selfic  : File selector code
wgl     : wgl front-end (to gd_wgl or x_wgl, depending on the context)
xdash   : A library to generate line patterns.
	  Used for vertical profiles and time series
xplot88 : A library to generate x-y graphs.
	  Used for vertical profiles and time series
x_wgl   : X Window implementation of wgl

xrec can be divided in 5 parts
Main interface code :      main
Important helper modules : select selfic gmp
X-Y Drawing routines :     autog xdash xplot88
Less important stuff :     xinit util
Basic drawing routines :   wgl gd_wgl x_wgl
