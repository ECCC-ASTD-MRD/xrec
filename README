To compile xrec
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic compilation recipe

cd ~/src/xrec (assuming this is where the source is)
make
make xrec
(make xrec does ... )
	cd main
	make xrec-$(ARCH) so if ARCH=Linux then make xrec-Linux

The final load is in main/Makefile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What you need

A FORTRAN Compiler
Open Motif or Lesstif (www.openmotif.org)
rmnlib (most of the modules : FSTD2000, base, primitives, readlx)
A from-RPN or localized version of r.compile and r.build
You have to create a directory $REC/lib/$ARCH

Some extra stuff
libgdb.a is a library developed by Michel Grenier from CMC (michel.grenier@ec.gc.ca)
to draw high resolution geography outline. You may ask him to get a compiled
library for your machine or access to the source code.
libgd2.a is GD implementation of GD. You can get a copy from http://www.boutell.com
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is in the directories

autog	: A library to generate x-y graphs. 
	  Used for vertical profiles and time series
gd_wgl  : GD implementation of wgl. For now unimpleminted filler code
gmp     : Geography drawing routines
include : The .h files needed by xrec
main    : where most of source of xrec is
select  : Record selector code
selfic  : File selector code
util    : Misc routines
wgl     : wgl front-end (to gd_wgl or x_wgl, regarding the context)
xdash   : A library to generate line patterns. 
	  Used for vertical profiles and time series
xinit   : Initialisation routines
xplot88 : A library to generate x-y graphs. 
	  Used for vertical profiles and time series
xvoir   : should not be there. Not part of xrec but uses the record selector.
x_wgl   : X Window implementation of wgl

xrec can be divided in 5 parts
Main interface code :      main
Important helper modules : select selfic gmp
X-Y Drawing routines :     autog xdash xplot88
Less important stuff :     xinit util
Basic drawing routines :   wgl gd_wgl x_wgl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential problems :
The port of the READLX package (from RMNLIB) may be difficult.
In the next implementation, READLX will be replaced by XML.
