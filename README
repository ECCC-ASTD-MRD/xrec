This file gives basic instructions on how to install and run xrec.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing and running xrec on a stick - Version 5.11.0
Environment and Climate Change Canada

To compile and run xrec on a stick (xoas), you will need:
- Fortran and C compilers,
- BLAS library (with development package),
- LAPACK library (with development package),
- libXm, libXt libraries (with development package),
- basic Unix utilities such as cmake (version 2.8.7 minimum), bash, sed,
  etc.

* Installing xoas
- Clone or download the git tar file of xrec at GitLab: http://gitlab.com/gem-ec/xoas
- cd xoas
- Execute the script named download-xrec-utilities.sh or download directly the
  file at the following address, and untar it:
  http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/outgoing/goas/xrec-utilities.tar.gz
  It contains data files, and a manual in pdf format.

#gfortran and gcc compilers
- xoas is already configured by default to use gfortran and gcc compilers
- make sure the compilers and libraries are in the appropriate
  PATHS: you may have to initialize ${PATH} and ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.
- changes to the C and Fortran flags can be done in the
  Linux-x86_64-gfortran.cmake file

#INTEL COMPILER
- by default, a configuration for Intel 19 is used for ifort compiler.
  You can use a configuration for Intel 16 by changing the symbolic link:
  - cd xoas/sources
  - rm Linux-x86_64-ifort.cmake
  - ln -s Linux-x86_64-ifort.cmake.16 Linux-x86_64-ifort.cmake
- changes to the C and Fortran flags can be done in the
  Linux-x86_64-ifort.cmake file
- make sure the compilers and libraries are in the appropriate
  PATHS: you may have to initialize ${PATH} and ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.

* Compiling and installing xrec
- cd xoas/sources
- mkdir -p build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- if you want to compile with another compiler than gfortran:
  cmake -DCOMPILER=ifort ..
  or
  cmake -DCOMPILER=pgfortran ..
  or
  edit the sources/CMakeLists.txt to change the default compiler (line 9)
- if you get error messages or if compiler or compile options are not right:
  . remove the content of the build directory
  . make appropriate changes to the cmake file named according to the
    Fortran compiler you are using, in the sources directory:
    Linux-x86_64-gfortran.cmake if you compile with gfortran or
    Linux-x86_64-ifort.cmake if you compile with ifort
  . cmake ..
    or
    cmake -DCOMPILER=ifort ..
    or
    cmake -DCOMPILER=pgfortran ..
- make -j
- make install

- a directory named after the compiler you used and the operating system you
  compiled on (bin-OS_NAME-COMPILER_NAME: for example
  bin-Fedora-29_x86-64-gfortran-8.3.1) is created in the work directory of
  xoas, and a binary named xrec is installed in it.

* Running xrec
- cd xoas/work/bin-[OS_NAME-COMPILER_NAME]
- export ARMNLIB=$PWD/../armnlib
- ./xrec -imflds [rpn_std_file]
